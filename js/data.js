Users can define the distances by themselves. They can simply hold the clothes in front of Kinect’s camera and scan it. They can operate this function using hand gestures with Kinect.</li><li>• Fit: users can try the clothes on by retrieving the data from the software with hand gestures interacted with Kinect. The software will detect the face of the user and draw the clothes the user selects accordingly.</li><li>• Once the user stays on any button for more than 1 second, it triggers a click, and the application will give a click sound to indicate the user that the action is completed. It will give the user a feedback to know the operation has been done.</li><li>• Video demonstration: <br><iframe src=//player.vimeo.com/video/83082921 width=500 height=389 frameborder=0 webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></li></ul>"

  "keys": "<ul><li>•  Researched a solution for web browsers that do not support WebGL or computers that do not have strong graphic cards to load our 3D interactive contents. The outcome of it is to develop a lite version of our current 3D engine, which has similar functions such as floor plan navigation and stair buttons for user to navigate through different floors. It is similar to Google Street View where users can still explore the 3D models using the moderate computers or any kind of browsers. It is suitable and seamless across different browsers from Windows IE8 to Google Chrome, and it was written in pure, low-level JavaScript and html. Demo: http://labs.floored.com/fallback/#/fallback/data/North-Forest-Pilot-Suite-201 </li><li>• Help modify, add, and improve features to the production using jQuery. For example, implement different UI upon clients’ requests, change the floor plan when navigating to different floors, implement colliders or bounding boxes for certain models, and navigate to different spots in the model with one click or the space bar. Demo: http://labs.floored.com/clients/g-holdings/214-west-39/ </li><li>• Built a website that demonstrates each units’ information within a building and calculate the total space sqft of the selected units using html5, WebGL, ThreeJS, AngularJS, and gulp (Node.js). The users can modify the units’ information using a specific Google Spreadsheet that we provide. The website can be found here: http://labs.floored.com/terminal-stores/</li><li>• Collaborate with 10 modelers and the business team to come up with the satisfying product for our clients. </li><li>• Utilize Kinect’s gesture recognition and send out keyboard commands based on the body movement to move the viewer position within a 3D scene.</li></ul>"
